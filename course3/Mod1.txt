Define Moore's law and explain why it has now stopped being true. 
Be sure to describe all of the physical limitations that have prevented Moore's law from continuing to be true.

Moore's law was the observation that the density of transistors on a chip would double every two years.  This
decrease in transistor size had the benefit of increased performance.  However, the increase in density increased 
the power consumption which increased the heat production creating high temperatures on the transistors and the 
risk of melting.

The first observed physical limitation then was this power wall.  But there are other physical characteristics that 
contribute to the power wall: the switching rate and the voltage magnitude.  Switching causes more  power 
consumptions: the higher the switching, the higher the power.  This creates a limit on the rate that the clock can 
be increased.  The voltage magnitude contributes to power consumption in a quadratic way.  Voltage can be decreased 
but there is also a voltage threshold to prevent noise from significantly interfering with discerning the voltage 
magnitudes necessary to distinguish between a "1" and a "0".
