Write a program to sort an array of integers. The program should partition the array into 4 parts, 
each of which is sorted by a different goroutine. Each partition should be of approximately equal size. 
Then the main goroutine should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array.

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers. Each goroutine which sorts ¼ of the array 
should print the subarray that it will sort. When sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the 
entire sorted list.


Write a program which prompts the user to enter integers and stores the integers in a sorted slice. 

The program should be written as a loop. Before entering the loop, the program should create an empty 
integer slice of size (length) 3. During each pass through the loop, the program prompts the user to 
enter an integer to be added to the slice. The program adds the integer to the slice. The slice must grow in size 
to accommodate any number of integers which the user decides to enter. The program should only quit 
(exiting the loop) 
when the user enters the character ‘X’ instead of an integer.

, sorts the slice, 
and prints the contents of the slice in sorted order.
